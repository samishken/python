#print function is part of the basic Python language, 
# whenever we use keywords or functions that are part of the language, 
# we're using the programming language's syntax to tell the computer what to do. 
# Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct instructions

print("Hello, World!")  # quotation mark signals that it's a "string"

print("I'm programming in Python!")
